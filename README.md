# TreefortBnB Visualization Example

Using Jupyter Notebooks, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, I analyze data from the [Pricenomics Data Puzzle](https://priceonomics.com/the-priceonomics-data-puzzle-treefortbnb/). 

Looking at the visualization (treebnb.png), we can answer things like
* Which cities have the highest median TreefortBnB list price?
* Which cities have the most listings?
* Which states have the most expensive listings?
